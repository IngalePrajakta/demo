            <h2>Cities</h2>
            <p>A city is a large human settlement.[4][5] Cities generally have extensive systems for housing,</p>
            <p>transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates</p>   
            <p>interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting</p> 
            <p>different parties in the process.</p>

              London is the capital of and largest city in England and the United Kingdom, with the largest municipal 
              population in the European Union.[7][8] Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, 
              at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement 
              for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[9] The City of London, London's ancient core − 
              an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries 
              that follow closely its medieval limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner 
              London borough holding city status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.
